# ImprovedQuickSort
This repo contains the ImprovedQuickSort class which takes the original Quick Sort code and improves it by using the median of the first, middle, and last elements in the partition, instead of the first.

To achieve this, two new methods were added: middleOfTheThree which uses the swap method to return the median of the first, middle, and last elements.
